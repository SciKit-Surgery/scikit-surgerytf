    "The Problem\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with research software include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code that only one researcher can run.\n",
    "* Hard coded parameters, with unknown history. i.e. what params have been tested? When? With what version of code?\n",
    "* At the end of a project, the code dies, is not re-used, and subsequent researchers feel compelled to re-implement it, in their own nuanced way, thereby wasting time, and also repeating the same loop. This may not be a huge concern in the era of deep-learning, as a new student/researcher will likely implement something newer. But if you want to use an algorithm in any other piece of code, the code must be designed for re-use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solution\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is written as a learning and demonstration exercise. The aim is to develop code that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* has core functions, run and tested via unit tests.\n",
    "* has application level code, run via the command line.\n",
    "* can be used within jupyter notebooks, as this is good for development and supervision meetings.\n",
    "* can be pip installed by others, and re-used as it, with almost zero effort.\n",
    "* is designed for re-use, i.e. a clear, simple interface, so the code can be directly embedded in other third party programs, such as GUI's or other scripts, without cutting-and-pasting, and without being stuck with hard-coded parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification itself is inspired by the standard tensor flow tutorials, such as [this one](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) and [this one](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started)."
