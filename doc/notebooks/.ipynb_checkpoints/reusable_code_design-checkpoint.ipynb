    "# Making Re-Usable Code - Some Design Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Matt Clarkson, 2019-10-30\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with research software include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code that only one researcher can run.\n",
    "* At the end of a project, the code dies, is not re-used, and subsequent researchers feel compelled to re-implement it, in their own nuanced way, thereby wasting time, and also repeating the same loop. This may not be a huge concern in the era of deep-learning, as a new researcher will likely implement something newer and better. But if you want to use an algorithm in any other piece of code, the code must be designed for re-use.\n",
    "* Hard coded parameters, with unknown history. i.e. what params have been tested? When? With what version of code?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher should develop code that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. is designed for re-use, i.e. a clear, simple interface, so the code can be directly embedded in other third party programs, such as GUI's or other scripts, without cutting-and-pasting.\n",
    "2. has core functions, run and tested via unit tests.\n",
    "3. has command line entry points so an untrained user can just run it.\n",
    "4. can be used within jupyter notebooks, as this is good for development and supervision meetings.\n",
    "5. can be pip installed by others, and re-used as is, with almost zero effort.\n",
    "6. has no hard-coded parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we implement a simple classifier in TensorFlow, to demonstrate the above steps.\n",
    "The classification code itself is inspired by the standard Fashion MNIST tensor flow tutorials, such as [this one](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) and [this one](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started). The classifer per se, is not the point of the tutorial. The point is to demonstrate how to make code that can be widely re-used."

    "### Class interface\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can choose either a class-based interface, or a function-based interface. I chose class.  A class is a way of grouping data-members and methods into a coherent concept, and providing encapsulation. So, just like a black box, the user doesn't have to know the internals of how a class works, they can just use the interface. If you chose a function based approach, then related methods are not easily grouped together, and its not obvious how separate methods are related, or in which order the should or must be called. So in the long run, funtion-based code, with lots of functions gets more disjoint and messy. So I prefer a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in file ```sksurgerytf/models/fashion.py``` we basically have the following, written as pseudo-code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FashionMNIST:\n",
    "    __init__(params)\n",
    "    train()\n",
    "    test(image_to_classify)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "* The constructor is responsible for initialising the network. See [this](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) article by Martin Fowler, and how the class is loading/preparing data. Also see [this](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/fashion_design.ipynb) on RAII and books by Scott Meyer to get the idea that once the constructor is complete, you should have a fully usable object. i.e. you must never allow an unusable or unready object to exist.\n",
    "* ```train()``` method to train the network. In this example, the ```train()``` method is called from within the constructor. You could call it separately.\n",
    "* ```test()``` method to classify each new image. This would be something that a 3rd party user would call, without knowing what goes on inside the black box.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by using encapsulation, and a simple class API, we have addressed point 1 of our proposed solution."

    "### Modules for Functions/Classes and Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Under ```sksurgerytf/``` we can put any other sub-modules, classes and functions as necessary. \n",

    "\n",
    "```shell\n",

Try to break out your functionality into bits you can test without running a full training cycle, i.e. test with dummy data.\n",

    "### Command Line Entry Point\n",
    "\n",
    "For bash scripting, or for working with other people, it is useful to have a command line entry point. This repo provides a pattern that you can just copy for each command line entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the top level python script:\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "which calls through to the ```fashion.py``` module created above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, a non-trained user can just run the code, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  # To setup the same virtualenv as tox installed\n",
    "  source .tox/py36/bin/activate\n",

    "  # Run program, just printing command line args\n",
    "  python sksurgeryfashion.py --help\n",
    "  ```\n",

In the first example, its not obvious if calling the setters is mandatory, and in which order they should be called. Also, if you ```train()``` once, then call a setter and ```train()``` again, what should the expected behaviour be? The object is being re-used, so does the training re-start from scratch or where it left off? Does the new parameter value take effect for the second training, or does setting a parameter value cause the training to restart? All of these points can of course be clarified with effective documentation for each method. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the point about the second example is that its more obvious to the 3rd party that the object is designed not to have the parameter values set once the object is constructed. In other languages such as ```C++``` this can be enforced via ```public, protected, private``` mechanisms. The fact that Python doesn't protect variables shouldn't dissuade you from the general idea that it is best to define the code to automatically indicate to the end user, the way in which a class is meant to, or designed to be used. \n",

The user should at least get the idea that to test new values, and new settings of hyperparameters for example, they are then required to make a new object, which makes it fairly obvious that the training is then starting from scratch.
